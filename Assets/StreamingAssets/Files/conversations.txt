Welcome to your first day at Insecta Inc. My name is Mantis. I run the show around here. I think you’ll fit in with everyone quite nicely. Let’s get you settled in, shall we?
***
Hi there! I heard you’re the newbie around here! I’m Beatrice, but you can call me Bea. Get it? Hahaha, I knew you would. You’re so intelligent afterall. I can tell just by looking at you that we’ll get along really well.
***
Oh, why hello there! It’s my pleasure to meet you. Is today your first day? I couldn’t even tell, you look like a pro. If you’re ever bored, come talk to me. I’ll always be there for you. Always. I love y- I mean, see ya later!
***
Yo, sup bro, how it be, tle. Ha see what I did there, I'm Brad the beetle. So yeah you look pretty cool, we should chill sometime. I have this cool crypto podcast I do with my roommate. We would love to have you on The Pod sometime bro. Anyways, catch ya on the flip dude.
***
Oh hi! I didn’t see you there I'm Sally Star. Sorry I just dropped my pen, let me grab that. OH NO! I’m so sorry I’m such a clumsy girl I got myself stuck in my own web. Please help me out.
***
Now that you’ve met everyone, I’ll properly introduce myself. I’m Mantis, and you can come to me if you need anything, I don’t bite! I’m just glad to find an employee that might get something done around here. Everyone around here is very, very friendly. Maybe a bit too friendly. Regardless, I know you’ll do what’s right. Why don’t you get started by helping out one of our busy bees with their work?
***
Oh hey, it’s you again! I hope you’re enjoying your time working here so far. You deserve to feel fulfilled at work. I can’t believe we haven’t seen each other since we met. Oh, and I wanted to ask you, do you like flowers?
***
Oh you do??? I do too! You’re so lovely! You have me buzzing!! I still live back at the hive with the folks. Is that ok with you?
***
Oh, neither do I. Anyone who likes flowers can buzz off. I still live back at the hive with the folks. Is that ok with you?
***
I bet all of them would just LOVE you! You’re as sweet as honey. Should we get back to working?
***
Oh… Well, I bet all of them would just LOVE you! You’re as sweet as honey. Should we get back to working?
***
Wow! You chose to come see me again today! You’re just so perfect. I bought you a bouquet of flowers. I saw them and they reminded me of you. Would you want to move in with me? I just really love you.
***
Wow, I didn’t expect someone as amazing as you to say yes. I can help you move in all of your things later on tonight! I can help you move your things around 6?
***
Oh, you’re right. Maybe it is too soon. Sorry if I came on too strong. I’m just attracted to you like pollen. I can help you move your things around 6?
***
Hiya! Good to see you as always. I must say, you’re glowing today my queen. Everyone in the hive is so happy to have you living with us now. They all seem to love you just as much as I do. I know the honeycomb is a bit… cozy. But you’ll get used to it! I have a large book collection back at the hive. Do you like to read?
***
Oh goodie, you should try reading Bug Catcher in the Rye. Such a classic. 
***
Oh that's a shame. I'm sure if you try a classic like Bug Catcher in the Rye you might change your mind. 
***
I'm so glad you're willing to take my recommendation! I have really good taste. Speaking of taste, be sure to be at the hive on Friday, I have someone for you to meet!
***
You're such an intellectual, you must have already read it! Wow, I knew you were great, but this is impressive. You have such good taste! Speaking of taste, be sure to be at the hive on Friday, I have someone for you to meet!
***
Oh, why hello! It’s my favorite coworker! I bet you’re doing amazing here so far. If you ever need any help, you should come to me. I’m employee of the month, afterall. Have been for 3 months straight. Are you impressed?
***
Why, thank you! You are so productive here, I’m just afraid you’ll steal my title! Hahaha! Anyway, I want to know more about you. Do you prefer picnics over barbeques?
***
Oh… I see. You are so productive here, I’m just afraid you’ll steal my title! Hahaha! Anyway, I want to know more about you. Do you prefer picnics over barbeques?
***
Huh, that’s my answer too! I love when folks are in the grass. Gives me a chance to catch a meal. Wouldn’t expect that from a firefly, though. Maybe we can get a meal together sometime?
***
Ah, that makes sense. I would definitely pick that if I were you. I live for picnics, though. Gives me a chance to catch a meal. Maybe we can get a meal together sometime?
***
Oh, why hello again! I’m so glad you could meet me for lunch. I have been starving all day! It’s been too long since anyone let themselves be my meal. You’re really such a sweetie. Oh, are you going to eat your lunch? Looks yummy!
***
Good! I know you don’t eat as much as a firefly, but it’s important for growth! Am I your favorite person here at the company yet?
***
Oh no!  I know you don’t eat as much as a firefly, but it’s important for growth! Am I your favorite person here at the company yet?
***
Good. That’s what I wanted to hear, I spend a lot of time trying to get you to like me. We are just so perfect together, don’t you agree?
***
Oh, don’t be silly. I think I am actually. No way you would spend all this time with me if I wasn’t your favorite! We are just so perfect together, don’t you agree?
***
I’m so glad we spent this lunch break together. I hope to see you soon!
***
Oh, why hello my lovebug! I’m so glad to see you, as always. It's so funny how we always bump into each other, isn’t it? Hahaha! I’m not following you, I swear. I’m so glad we’re getting so close. Would you want to eat together again soon?
***
I’m so glad. Last time was a blast! I was actually thinking we could do dinner together sometime soon? I didn’t want to be too forward, but I just really enjoy eating with you.
***
Oh really? I had a blast at our last lunch. Maybe dinner, after work instead?
***
Dinner it is then! I’ll see you at the end of the week. I’ll pick you up at 7.
***
Oh? No dinner? Well, then I’ll pick you up at the end of the week for a morning coffee instead.
***

Damn bro playing it close to the chest I can respect that. Especially with a bod like yours, well stop by the end of the week if you reconsider bro.
***
Oh hey sorry about before I'm just such a clutz sometimes. Thank you for helping me get unstuck. I keep getting fired from these jobs for being so clumsy. I was a delivery driver, a plumber, and a babysitter. Sorry, I keep talking about myself. Are you excited to start working here?
***
So was I. At first it was easy but now these days are sooo long I just can’t take it. I hope you will make it easier to take. I was going to have lunch but I realized I forgot it. I'm so forgetful. Do you have anything to eat?
***
Oh. I’m sorry to hear that. I hope I can cheer you up. Anyway I was hoping you could help me out. I forgot my lunch being the forgetful little spider I am. I was wondering do you have anything I could eat?
***
Oh thank you! I am so sorry to impose on your lunch I would just dread to not eat for another six hours. You have been so helpful to me today I would just love to spend more time with you. Having a friendly coworker like you just has so many benefits.
***
Oh I see. I guess I will just have to have leftovers when I get home. I was so looking forward to spending my day with you. I’m sorry I have been such a mess today. You can come by later and I can try and make it up to you.
***
I’m so glad you are going to help me again today. I just love working with new talent. It is always such fun. I hope you don’t mind. I spun you a hammock. Would you want to sit in it with me? I love spending time wrapping up a good friend.
***
Oh wonderful! I hope you don’t mind that my lunch is also in there, but don’t mind him, he’s not nearly the snack you are. You truly are such a wonderful assistant. You make this scene so much more fun. Anyway, are you liking this job? It's much less of a bore now that you’re around.
***
Oh I see. No, it’s ok, you don't have to. I just thought it would be nice to have a deeper connection with my coworker. I know you are busy but I hope we can find some time to do some work together. Are you at least liking the job? It must be so hard being the new guy.
***
I’m happy to hear that. I know it’s hard to get a start in this industry, but you can do it! It’s really all about building a web of connections. You're stuck in there? Oh my! What a shame. I hope you don’t mind. I like having you around. I'll come grab you tomorrow.
***
Oh no that's such a shame. Too bad you are stuck here with silly ol’ me. I just want our time together to be pleasant. I guess I’ll see you around. Oh? You're stuck! Oh my, it looks like some of my web leaked out, it happens sometimes. I guess you will just have to spend the night here.
***
Oh, you managed to escape on your own. What a shame I was hoping for a little treat when I got back. Either way I’m glad you came back for more. I know I can be a lot but I just get so tangled up when I find someone I want. Will you forgive me? I can make it up to you.
***
Aww, that’s just what I wanted to hear. I’ve always wanted to be tied down by someone like you. I know just the thing for you, come find me at the end of the week and it will be ready. 
***
What a shame, you are just my type of morsel. Well, if you change your mind, come find me at the end of the week and I just might have a surprise for you.
